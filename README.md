This scripts are used to create incremental backups.


It is specific for my setup and some paths are hardcoded. The code can be used as a reference for
further implementation or adoptions.
Input on generalization for the code welcome

- backup scripts to backup rootfs (backup_root.sh) and home (backup_home.sh)
- backup_root.sh must be run as root

run install.sh !
